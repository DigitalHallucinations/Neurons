# Entangled Quantum-Inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neural Architecture for Enhanced Cross-Layer Communication

## Abstract

We present a novel neural architecture that incorporates quantum-inspired entanglement principles into classical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. Our Quantum-inspired LIF (qLIF) neuron pairs demonstrate enhanced cross-layer communication and temporal coherence in artificial neural networks. 
## 1. Introduction

Modern artificial neural networks face significant challenges in maintaining coherent communication across different processing layers and cognitive subsystems. While traditional architectures rely on explicit synaptic connections for information transfer, biological neural systems demonstrate more sophisticated forms of coordination and synchronization. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired approach to neural architecture that addresses these limitations through simulated entanglement between neuron pairs.

### 1.1 Background

Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons have long served as fundamental building blocks in neuromorphic computing and computational neuroscience. However, their classical architecture limits their ability to maintain temporal coherence and efficient cross-layer communication in complex cognitive tasks.

### 1.2 Motivation

The need for improved cross-layer communication and temporal coherence in artificial neural networks motivates our research. Current architectures struggle with:
- Maintaining synchronization across cognitive subsystems
- Efficient emotional modulation of decision-making processes
- Temporal coherence in continuous processing streams
- Energy-efficient long-range information transfer

## 2. The Entangled qLIF Architecture

### 2.1 Theoretical Foundation

Our architecture extends the classical LIF neuron model by incorporating principles inspired by quantum entanglement. Each qLIF neuron pair maintains both classical membrane potential dynamics and a simulated quantum state that allows for non-local correlation between neurons.

### 2.2 Mathematical Framework

The qLIF neuron pair is defined by the following equations:

1. Classical LIF dynamics:
```
dV/dt = -(V(t) - V_rest)/τ + I(t)/C
```

2. Quantum state evolution:
```
|Ψ(t)⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

3. Entanglement correlation:
```
ρ_AB = |Ψ_e⟩⟨Ψ_e|
```

### 2.3 Implementation Details

The architecture is implemented through:
1. Paired neuron initialization with shared quantum states
2. Modified membrane potential dynamics
3. Entanglement-based state updates
4. Synchronized firing mechanisms
